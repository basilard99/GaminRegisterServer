Look. I know. There's a lot of people out there who would say "Why are you
testing your database stuff?? That should be an integration test." Well,
leaving aside any discussion about that, the reason I'm doing database tests is
simple: I'm not familiar with Neo4j, nor the Javascript module that wraps it,
so I wrote the tests to play with it and give me some examples to work with.
